# Sample code of Pro Design Patterns in Swift

This is sample code of Adam Freeman's [Pro Design Patterns in Swift](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Swift-Adam-Freeman/dp/148420395X).

I downloaded the code from the book's Japanese version publisher's [link](https://www.shoeisha.co.jp/book/download/9784798142494),
or you can also find [here](https://github.com/Apress/pro-design-patterns-in-swift).

The book has been published for years and the sample code was written with Xcode 6, so it **won't be able to compile if you want to run on latest Xcode.**

I make my own version of design patters in Swift following this sameple code and develop it with Xcode 11, you can check my [Design Pattern Swift](https://github.com/hayasilin/design-pattern-swift).
